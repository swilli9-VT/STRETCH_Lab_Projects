    - Physics-informed neural networks which employ Schwarz-alternating domain decomposition to solve a 1-D advection-diffusion PDE with a sharp gradient.
3. Tear_Propagation_Project
    - Work in progress.
    - Codes for defining finite element material properties and gathering simulation results data regarding vaginal tear propagation.
    - Codes for modeling said results data using feed-forward neural networks, 1-D convolutional neural networks, and domain decompostion
